## Regex-Project 

As a web development student I want a tutorial explaining a specific regex so that I can understand the search pattern the regex defines.

## Summary
(Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.) `/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$`

Using the above expression will allow a user to seardh for a match URL. During this gist we will break this down.
